# Linux Basics Introduction

Linux is an open-source operating system whose kernel was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

Many companies and organizations develop their own Linux distributions based on the Linux operating system, such as Google, Red Hat, Ubuntu, etc.

Currently, the ROS system mainly runs on the Ubuntu operating system, which is based on the Debian Linux distribution.

Therefore, if you want to deeply learn and practice robotics, it's best to install the Ubuntu operating system on your computer using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), or a virtual machine like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html).

More importantly, most current artificial intelligence environments are based on the Ubuntu operating system, so for learning and practicing robotics, it's best to work in an Ubuntu environment.

## Terminal

First, we need to understand one thing: the terminal.

The terminal is a text interface where users can input commands, and the operating system will execute corresponding operations based on the commands entered by the user.

In the Ubuntu operating system, the terminal is a very important tool. Users can execute various commands in the terminal, such as installing software, configuring the system, running programs, etc.

Press the ctrl key, alt key, and t key simultaneously to summon a terminal interface:

In this image, s is the username, the part after the @ separator is the hostname ubuntu, : is a separator symbol, and ~ represents the current user's home directory, which is also the current path where the terminal is located.

You can input some commands in this black box to perform corresponding operations. For example, input the ls command to list the files and folders in the current directory.

Or input the cd command to switch the current directory. For example, input

```bash
cd ~/ 
```

to switch to the current user's home directory, which is the default path when opening the terminal.

### Linux Basic Commands Mini-Experiment (Follow Step by Step)

#### Experiment Safety Notice (Very Important)

In this experiment, you will encounter **commands that actually modify files and directories**. Please read carefully:

- **`rm` and `mv` directly delete or move files**
- **`rm -rf` is extremely dangerous; once the path is wrong, data cannot be recovered**
- **This experiment only allows operations under `~` (your home directory)**
- **It is strictly forbidden to execute `rm -rf` in system directories such as `/`, `/home`, `/usr`**
- **You will be responsible for repair or compensation costs if the system is damaged due to misoperation**

**Feel free to ask questions if you don't understand**

---

#### I. Experiment Objectives

Through a complete mini-experiment, master the following:

- **Path concepts** in the Linux terminal
- Common file/directory operation commands: `ls mkdir touch cp mv rm find cat`
- Using `gedit` to create and edit files
- Using different methods to execute Python programs, understanding:
  - Relative paths
  - Absolute paths
  - `~` (home directory)
- Understanding basic system and network commands: `ping`, `top`
- Learning to execute a **complete automation script**

---

#### Tips

**Copy and Paste**:
To copy in the terminal, use `ctrl + shift + c`. To paste, use `ctrl + shift + v`. If you press `ctrl + v` in the terminal, invisible characters will appear, and you'll need to press backspace twice to delete them.

**Closing Programs**: In the terminal, close programs using `ctrl + c`, and force terminate programs using `ctrl + z`.

**Adding a New Terminal**: Click the plus sign to add a new terminal:

#### II. Experiment 1: Manual Operations

##### 1. Check Current Location

Confirm you are currently in your **user directory (~)**.

```bash
pwd
ls
```

![1766555340932](image/1.linux/1766555340932.png)

---

##### 2. Create Experiment Workspace

```bash
mkdir linux_exp
cd linux_exp
ls
```

You can observe that the path before the $ symbol has changed.

---

##### 3. Create Files and Directories

In Windows, we use right-click to create files/folders, and in the terminal, we have corresponding commands:

```bash
mkdir src
touch note.txt
ls
```

![1766555416204](image/1.linux/1766555416204.png)

---

##### 4. Use gedit to Create a Python File

gedit is a text editor:

```bash
gedit src/hello.py
```

In the opened editor, input and save:

```python
print("Hello Linux")
```

The effect is shown below:

![1766555553397](image/1.linux/1766555553397.png)

Note that you need to save with `ctrl + s`. The * symbol here indicates there are unsaved modifications.

After saving, the effect is as shown:
![1766555600661](image/1.linux/1766555600661.png)

Click the terminal icon on the left.
![1766555668460](image/1.linux/1766555668460.png)

You can see that below the gedit command, there is no new place to input commands.
This is because the gedit text editor is running. You can press `ctrl` and `c` simultaneously in the terminal to close it.

![1766555794969](image/1.linux/1766555794969.png)

---

##### 5. Use find to Search for Files

We can search for files we want in folders

```bash
find ~ -name "hello.py"
```

![1766555832856](image/1.linux/1766555832856.png)

You can observe the path of this file. It starts with `/`, meaning this is an absolute path.

---

##### 6. View File Contents

```bash
cat src/hello.py
```

![1766555948024](image/1.linux/1766555948024.png)

---

##### 7. Copy, Move, Delete Files (Use Caution)

Copy

```bash
cp src/hello.py hello_copy.py
ls
```

Move/Rename

```bash
mv hello_copy.py hello_moved.py
ls
```

Delete

```bash
rm hello_moved.py
ls
```

You can observe the effects of these commands on files.

Note: **Do not use `rm -rf /` or randomly delete directories**

---

#### III. Experiment 2: Execute Python, Understand Paths

Make sure you are still in the `~/linux_exp` directory:

```bash
pwd
```

![1766556064568](image/1.linux/1766556064568.png)

##### Method 1: Relative Path

```bash
python3 src/hello.py
```

---

##### Method 2: Home Path

```bash
python3 ~/linux_exp/src/hello.py
```

---

##### Method 3: Absolute Path

```bash
python3 /home/<username>/linux_exp/src/hello.py
```

> Please replace `<username>` with the current terminal username, which is the string before @

---

##### Reflection

- Why do all three methods work?
- After you `cd ~`, which ones will still work?

---

#### IV. Experiment 3: System and Network Commands (Observation Only)

##### View Processes (Press q to exit)

```bash
top
```

![1766556108183](image/1.linux/1766556108183.png)

---

##### Test Network (Ctrl + C to stop)

Sometimes we use this command to test whether the host can access the internet.

```bash
ping baidu.com
```

![1766556153402](image/1.linux/1766556153402.png)

---

#### V. Experiment 4: One-Click Automation Script (Key Point)

We can write a script to automatically get today's weather in Shenzhen from the internet and execute the Python code we wrote above.

##### 1️⃣ Create Script File

```bash
cd ~/linux_exp  
gedit run_linux_exp.sh
```

Write the following content and save:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Linux Basic Experiment Script: Automatically Execute Python File ==="
python3 ~/linux_exp/src/hello.py

echo "=== Linux Basic Experiment Script: Get Today's Weather ==="
# Define the city to query (can be modified to your city, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou; supports Chinese and English)
CITY="Shenzhen"

# Output prompt information
echo "======================================"
echo "      Today's Weather Query (from wttr.in)"
echo "======================================"

# Get weather information from wttr.in and format output
curl -s "wttr.in/${CITY}?format=3"  # Minimal output (City: Weather Temperature)
# Script completion prompt
echo -e "\n======================================"
echo "              Query Complete"
echo "======================================"

```

![1766556181262](image/1.linux/1766556181262.png)

---

##### 2️⃣ Add Execute Permission

```bash
chmod +x run_linux_exp.sh
```

---

##### 3️⃣ Execute Script

```bash
./run_linux_exp.sh
```

![1766556218219](image/1.linux/1766556218219.png)

We can see that scripts are particularly powerful tools that can accomplish many tasks through Linux commands.

---

#### VI. Experiment Summary

In this experiment, you actually used and understood:

##### 📌 Three Path Writing Methods

- **Absolute path** `/home/<username>/linux_exp/src/hello.py`
- **Relative path** `src/hello.py`
- **Home path** `~/linux_exp/src/hello.py`

👉 **Whether a command succeeds depends on: where you are + how you write the path**

---

#### VII. Checklist (Self-Check)

- [ ] I know what `pwd` does
- [ ] I won't randomly use `rm -rf`
- [ ] I can understand every line of commands in the script
- [ ] I understand why the same Python file can be executed in multiple ways
